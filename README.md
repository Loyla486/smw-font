# SMW Font

A pixel font adapted from Super Mario World

## About this font

This is a recreation of the font used in the SNES game *Super Mario World*, as a modern computer font. I changed a few characters so they look nicer, and added a couple of new characters. It was made using yal.cc's pixel font converter (https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont).

The inspiration for this project is "ILLUSIYELLOW" by ssaamm (?), an earlier and more limited font that set out to do the same thing.

There's a variable-width and a monospace variant (the latter could in theory be used as a programming font).

## Usage

Install the .ttf or .otf files found in the Releases section.

(Apparently, only .otf files properly support kerning.)

## Extending this font with your own characters

You can edit this font yourself, the same way I made it.

Go to https://yal.cc/r/20/pixelfont, import the image (.png) and the settings (.json), make changes as you see fit (when you edit the image, re-import it), and export the font file.
