# Contributing

If you want to add characters to the font or improve the kerning, feel free to do so! You can make a pull request or something, and if I figure out how, I'll merge it.

For info on how to use the pixel font converter, see the "Extending this font with your own characters" section in README.md (or click the "Help" button in the tool itself).

Note the following:

- Please make the same changes to all three font variants, so they're up to date.
- Please increase the version number in the "Meta" tab. This doesn't use any specific versioning system, but I guess it makes sense to count up by 0.1 for individual changes, and 1.0 for complete overhauls (which I don't think will happen).
- Submit the .png and/or .json files, depending on what changed.
- I don't think you need to submit the generated font files themselves, because I'll probably be the one making releases? If that does come up, see the note on kerning in README.md (I had to run both the TTF and OTF files through a converter to make the kerning work).
